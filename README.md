# SQL-ANALYSIS
## Description
This project demonstrates the use of SQL for data analysis and database management through a simple Pets &amp; Owners database. It showcases the ability to design schemas, insert data, run analytical queries, and optimize performance using indexes.
The database consists of two main tables:
Owners → Stores information about 16 pet owners (first_name,Last_name,Owner_id contact details, city).
Pets → Stores information about 15 pets (Per_id,Name, kind, gender, age) and links them to their respective owners.
## Objective
The objective of this project is to design and analyze a relational Pets & Owners database using SQL. It aims to demonstrate core database skills such as schema creation, data insertion, joins, subqueries, views, and indexing to extract insights and optimize performance. Through this project, the goal is to showcase how SQL can be used to model real-world relationships, perform meaningful analysis, and prepare data for decision-making.
