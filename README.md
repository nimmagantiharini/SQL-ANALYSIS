# SQL-ANALYSIS
This project demonstrates the use of SQL for data analysis and database management through a simple Pets &amp; Owners database. It showcases the ability to design schemas, insert data, run analytical queries, and optimize performance using indexes.
The database consists of two main tables:
Owners → Stores information about 16 pet owners (first_name,Last_name,Owner_id contact details, city).
Pets → Stores information about 15 pets (Per_id,Name, kind, gender, age) and links them to their respective owners.
